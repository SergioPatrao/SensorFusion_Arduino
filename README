This repository is intended to those who want to use Inertial Sensors with Arduino and implment Sensor Fusion Algorithms.

As an example, it was used the LSM9DS0 breakout board from Adafruit which contains a 3D accelerometer, 3D gyroscope and 3D magnetometer.

This board was communicating with an Arduino Mega via I2C. 

A Sensor Fusion Library was also created to allow developers to implement Sensor Fusion algorithms directly on the Arduino.
